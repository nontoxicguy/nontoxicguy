I'm just a kiddo who fell in love with programming.
Started out with Roblox Studio, so I know lua (I know luau is not the same as lua but they are alike so I tried lua programming just to make a program that I never tested because it may be a "bomb").
Tried python and it's mid.
I really like C# though, started it with Unity (game engine).

Finding a good open-sourced on Github project is pretty hard :(
